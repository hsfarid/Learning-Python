# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 7)

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)
print(a ** b)
print( a // b)
