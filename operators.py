# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 7)


# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)
print(a ** b)
print( a // b)


x = 6
y = 4
print(x + y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)
print(x - y)
print(x ** y)
print(x // y) 

# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
x = 4
x += 3
x -= 3
x *= 3
x /= 3
x %= 3
x //= 3

# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
x = 4
y = 5
print(x == y)
print(x < y)
print(x <= y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x >= y)

# Python Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
# and, or, not

# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
# is, is not

# Python Membership Operators
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
# in, not in
