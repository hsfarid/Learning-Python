# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# x = 6
# y = 4
# print(x + y)
# print(x * y)
# print(x / y)
# print(x % y)
# print(x - y)
# print(x ** y)
# print(x // y) 

# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
# x = 4
# x += 3
# x -= 3
# x *= 3
# x /= 3
# x %= 3
# x //= 3

# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
x = 4
y = 5
print(x == y)
print(x < y)
print(x <= y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x >= y)
